# Ratatouille Application
Welcome to the Ratatouille application, a Swift UI project that utilizes TheMealDB API to create a Disney Ratatouille recipe app. This app allows users to explore and prepare their favorite dishes based on various categories, ingredients, and countries.

# Features:
Recipe Exploration
Browse and discover recipes from a wide range of categories.
Find recipes based on specific ingredients, allowing for a personalized culinary experience.
Country-based Meals
Explore meals based on their country of origin.
While the ability to edit country-specific details (such as the flag) is planned, it hasn't been implemented due to time constraints during the exam period.
Save and Modify Meals
Save your favorite recipes to a favorites list.
Although the functionality to modify saved recipes is intended, it has not been fully implemented within the application.
Archive Meals
Archive meals based on categories or preferences.
The feature to modify archived meals is planned, offering users greater control over their culinary collections.

# Note:
Due to time constraints during the exam period, certain planned features, such as modifying country-based details and editing saved or archived meals, were not fully implemented. The application aims to provide a delightful recipe exploration experience with future enhancements in mind.

Feel free to explore the Ratatouille application, and we appreciate your understanding regarding the pending features.
